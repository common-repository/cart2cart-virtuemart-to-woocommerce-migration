== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to export Virtuemart products to WooCommerce? =
Cart2Cart supports the migration of products to WooCommerce. However, due to WooCommerce peculiarities, the service transfers them as product variants. In this case, we recommend installing the Product [Add-Ons](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-add-ons/) plugin (it’s paid) on your WooCommerce store prior to the data transfer so that your product options could be moved directly into the plugin without being converted to variants.

= Will my VirtueMart customer passwords be transferred during WooCommerce migration? =
Yes, Cart2Cart transfers passwords from VirtueMart to WooCommerce, provided that the store has default settings and no changes have been made to the custom code.

= Can I migrate credit card information from Virtuemart to WooCommerce? =
Absolutely. Cart2Cart supports the users' credit card data transfer from VirtueMart to WooCommerce if such data was provided by clients. Billing and shipping addresses' information will be transferred successfully too.

= Can I migrate store taxes from VirtueMart to WooCommerce? =
Yes, sure. However, after migration to WooCommerce, the taxes will be already included in product prices.
